######### arena-parent.yml ###
## Any settings that an individual arena config leaves out will be inherited
##  from this arena config.
## All of the options must be defined here in order for configuration to work
##  correctly when the messages are left out of a child config.
## Messages section can use both & color codes and # color codes.
##
## All comments that are not in this header will be removed.
##
## Extensive documentation COMING SOON. Will be available at
##  https://github.com/daboross/SkyWars/wiki when created.
